# Early Stage Diabetes Risk Predictor App
The Early Stage Diabetes Risk Predictor App is designed to assist users in assessing their risk of developing diabetes. Utilizing a dataset containing various signs and symptoms of individuals who are newly diabetic or at risk, this app provides both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) prediction capabilities.

# Features:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Users can visualize and analyze the dataset, exploring demographic distributions and other insightful statistics.
* Machine Learning Model: Input personal health attributes to receive a risk assessment for diabetes, along with a probability score indicating the likelihood of being diabetic.

# Data Source:
The app utilizes the Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
